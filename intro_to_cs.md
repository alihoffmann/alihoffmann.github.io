## I don't know why this is not working correctly,
# Course Content
The goal of this course is to teach students how fundamental computer processes actually work.
The course is broken down into the following areas. 

* Bits/bytes, integers, and floating point numbers
* Assembly Language and how machines work on a low level
* Hardware Caches
* Dynamic Memory Allocation and Virtual Memory
* Exception Control Flow and System Level I/O
* Network Programming
* Concurrent Programming, Synchronization, and Threads

If you are interested in browsing the course contents more throughly, check the course website here: www.cs.cmu.edu/~213 .

In this course, we mainly learned through labs where we built out cache simulators, memory allocators, proxy servers, etc. It is important to remember that this is an *introductory* course, so we built light versions of their contemporary counterparts.

These are the labs that were assigned in the course. I would love to share snippets of my code, but it would be an Academic Integrity Violation to publish that information :(

1. Data Lab

2. Bomb Lab

3. Attack Lab

4. Cache Lab

5. Malloc Lab

6. Tsh Lab

7. Proxy Lab
