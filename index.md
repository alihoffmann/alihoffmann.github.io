## THIS IS NOT WORKING WELL

## A bit about me

Hi! Welcome to my website (I'm excited to have a place to share my thoughts and experiences with you). I'm currently a student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I love spending time baking (and cooking), hiking, and solving puzzles.

## What I do @ CMU

I would consider myself very involved on campus, I have held some form of a job since the spring semester of my Freshman year, and I've been involved with several organizations on campus.
Strong Women Strong Girls, Fringe, SWE, WinECE, and Engineering Student Council.

## Coursework

I've taken quite a few courses at CMU. These are the courses I took in the Spring semester, and the courses I plan on taking in the Fall.

## Work Experience

As I've grown, I have continued to try new things, and I'm excited to keep learning!

## Life

My goal is to spend more time discussing my hobies, mainly baking, and my beliefs and realizations from struggles and challenges in my life.
